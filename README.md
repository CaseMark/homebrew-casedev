# homebrew-casedev

Homebrew tap for the [case.dev CLI](https://github.com/CaseMark/casedotdev-mono/tree/preview/apps/cli).

## Install

```bash
brew install casemark/casedev/casedev
```

## Usage

```bash
casedev --version
casedev help
casedev auth login
```

## How it works

The `casedev.rb` formula is auto-updated by the [CLI release workflow](https://github.com/CaseMark/casedotdev-mono/blob/preview/.github/workflows/cli-release.yml) on every stable release. Do not edit the formula manually.
